**3-Tier Flask Application with PostgreSQL Database, React.js Frontend, and Flask Python Backend Overview**

This repository contains a 3-tier web application built using Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and React.js for the frontend. The application follows the traditional three-tier architecture, where the frontend, backend, and database layers are separated to enhance modularity and scalability.

**Components**
**Frontend (React.js):**

The frontend directory contains the React.js application.
Dependencies are listed in the frontend/package.json file.
Use npm install to install the required dependencies.
To start the frontend development server, run npm start.
Backend (Flask):

**The backend directory contains the Flask application.**
Install dependencies using pip install -r backend/requirements.txt.
Configure the database connection in backend/config.py.
To run the Flask backend, execute python backend/app.py.
Database (PostgreSQL):

**The application uses PostgreSQL as the database.**
Create a PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in backend/config.py.
Configuration
Frontend Configuration:
Update API endpoint in frontend/src/config.js to point to your Flask backend.
javascript
Copy code
// frontend/src/config.js

const API_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:5000/api'; // Update with your backend API endpoint
export default API_ENDPOINT;
Backend Configuration:
Configure the database connection in backend/config.py.
python
Copy code
# backend/config.py

class Config:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database'  # Update with your database connection details
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    
**Running the Application**
**Database Setup:**
**Create a PostgreSQL database.**
Update the database connection details in backend/config.py.
Backend Setup:

**Navigate to the backend directory.**
Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask application with python app.py.
Frontend Setup:

**Navigate to the frontend directory.**
Install dependencies with npm install.
Start the React development server with npm start.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
**Additional Notes**
This README provides a basic setup guide. Customize and extend it based on your project's specific requirements.
Ensure that you have PostgreSQL, Python, npm, and Node.js installed on your machine before running the application.
Feel free to explore and enhance the application based on your needs. Happy coding!
